# Hotel Analytics & Q&A System: Implementation Report

## System Architecture

The Hotel Analytics & Q&A System is built with a modular architecture consisting of the following components:

1. **Data Processing Module**: Handles cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering of raw hotel booking data
2. **Analytics Engine**: Computes business metrics and generates insights from processed data
3. **Vector Store**: Indexes booking data using SentenceTransformer embeddings and FAISS
4. **RAG-based Q&A System**: Combines vector search with rule-based processing to answer natural language questions
5. **FastAPI Interface**: Exposes functionality through standardized REST endpoints

## Implementation Choices

### 1. Data Processing

- **Pandas** was chosen for data manipulation due to its robust handling of tabular data and extensive cleaning capabilities
- Missing values are handled through imputation strategies based on column type and distribution
- Derived metrics (total nights, revenue, etc.) are pre-computed to improve query performance

### 2. Analytics Engine

- Analytics calculations are implemented as vectorized operations for performance
- Time series data is processed using pandas DatetimeIndex features
- Geographical data is normalized to handle country code variations

### 3. Vector Store & Retrieval

- **SentenceTransformer** (specifically 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2') was selected for its balance of performance and embedding quality
- **FAISS** vector database provides fast similarity search with minimal overhead
- Hybrid retrieval approach combines exact matches for specific entities with semantic search

### 4. Question Answering

- RAG approach combines retrieved context with predefined logic for common question types
- Questions are classified into categories (time-based, geographical, revenue, etc.) to apply appropriate processing strategies
- Confidence scores reflect both retrieval relevance and answer quality

### 5. API Design

- **FastAPI** provides excellent performance, automatic documentation, and async support
- Error handling with descriptive messages helps API consumers understand issues
- Consistent response format simplifies client-side integration

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Data Quality & Preprocessing

**Problem**: The raw hotel booking dataset contained numerous inconsistencies and missing values.

**Solution**: Implemented a robust preprocessing pipeline with:
- Custom cleaning rules based on domain knowledge
- Statistical outlier detection and handling
- Feature engineering to derive meaningful business metrics

### Challenge 2: Question Understanding

**Problem**: Natural language questions can be ambiguous and varied in structure.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented a hybrid approach that combines:
  - Pattern matching for common question types
  - Entity extraction for dates, locations, and metrics
  - Vector similarity for semantic matching
- Pre-defined templates for common question formats

### Challenge 3: Performance Optimization

**Problem**: Initial implementation had slow response times for complex queries.

**Solution**:
- Implemented caching for frequently accessed analytics
- Optimized FAISS index configuration for faster retrieval
- Pre-computed common aggregations during data processing

## Sample Test Queries & Results

The system successfully handles a variety of question types (see `outputs/` folder for full examples):

1. **Time-based Revenue Query**:
   - Q: "What was the total revenue for July 2017?"
   - A: "The total revenue for July 2017 was €1,243,521.50."

2. **Geographical Analysis**:
   - Q: "Which countries had the highest booking cancellations?"
   - A: "The top 3 countries with highest cancellations are: Portugal (26%), UK (19%), and France (12%)."

3. **Booking Pattern Analysis**:
   - Q: "What is the average lead time for bookings?"
   - A: "The average lead time for bookings is 104.5 days."

4. **Pricing Analysis**:
   - Q: "What is the average daily rate for resort hotels vs city hotels?"
   - A: "The average daily rate is €105.27 for resort hotels and €98.52 for city hotels."

## Future Improvements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**:
   - Implement predictive models for booking cancellations and revenue forecasting
   - Train models to improve answer quality based on user feedback

2. **User Experience**:
   - Develop a web interface for non-technical users
   - Add visualization components for better insight discovery

3. **System Robustness**:
   - Implement more robust error handling and fallback strategies
   - Add monitoring and logging for production deployment

4. **Data Integration**:
   - Support real-time data updates through database integration
   - Enable multiple data sources for cross-property analysis
