# Hotel Analytics & Q&A System

This project processes hotel booking data, generates analytics reports, and provides natural language question answering using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The system leverages FastAPI for the REST API, Pandas for data processing, and FAISS with SentenceTransformer for vector-based retrieval.

## Project Overview

This system is designed to:
- **Preprocess** raw hotel booking data by cleaning and structuring it.
- **Generate Analytics Reports** that include metrics such as total bookings, average daily rate, cancellation rate, revenue trends, geographical distribution, and booking lead time statistics.
- **Answer Questions** about the data using a combination of predefined logic and a FAISS-based vector retrieval system.
- **Expose REST API Endpoints** via FastAPI for integration and testing.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Cleans raw data, handles missing values, computes additional metrics (e.g., total nights, total price), and stores the processed file.

- **Analytics Reporting:**  
  Calculates and returns key metrics including:
  - Total bookings  
  - Average daily rate  
  - Cancellation rate  
  - Revenue trends over time  
  - Geographical distribution  
  - Booking lead time statistics

- **Retrieval-Augmented Q&A:**  
  Uses FAISS and SentenceTransformer to index booking summaries and retrieve relevant information when answering questions.

- **REST API:**  
  Built with FastAPI, the API includes the following endpoints:
  - **POST /analytics:** Returns the analytics report.
  - **POST /ask:** Answers booking-related questions.

- **Automated Testing & Benchmarking:**  
  Tests using pytest are provided, along with scripts or tools for benchmarking API performance.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-analytics.git
   cd hotel-analytics
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   The `requirements.txt` includes:
   - fastapi==0.115.11
   - uvicorn==0.34.0
   - python-multipart==0.0.20
   - pandas==2.2.3
   - numpy==2.2.4
   - scikit-learn==1.6.1
   - sentence-transformers==3.4.1
   - faiss-cpu==1.7.3
   - httpx==0.24.1
   - pytest==7.4.0

## Usage

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Place Your Raw Data:**  
   Ensure your raw CSV file (e.g., `hotel_bookings.csv`) is located at the path defined in `src/data/preprocessing.py` (adjust if necessary).

2. **Run the Preprocessing Script:**

   ```bash
   python src/data/preprocessing.py
   ```

   This will create a processed CSV file (e.g., `hotel_bookings_processed.csv`) in the designated folder.

### Starting the API Server

1. **Run the FastAPI Server:**

   ```bash
   uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Access the API:**  
   - The API runs on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
   - Swagger UI documentation is available at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)

### API Endpoints

- **POST /analytics:**  
  Returns a JSON report containing analytics metrics such as total bookings, average daily rate, cancellation rate, revenue trends, geographical distribution, and lead time statistics.

- **POST /ask:**  
  Accepts a JSON payload with a question (e.g., `"Show me total revenue for July 2017"`) and returns an answer based on both predefined logic and FAISS-based vector retrieval.

## Testing & Performance

- **Run Automated Tests:**

   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

- **Benchmarking:**  
  Use the provided benchmarking scripts or tools (e.g., Apache Bench, Postman Runner) to measure API response times and FAISS retrieval performance.

## Deployment

For deployment, consider the following options:
- **Containerization:** Create a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
- **Cloud Hosting:** Deploy on platforms like Heroku, AWS, Railway, or DigitalOcean.
- **Instructions:** Update deployment steps here based on your chosen method.

## Optional Enhancements

- **Real-time Data Updates:**  
  Integrate a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL) to update data dynamically as new records arrive.
  
- **Query History Tracking:**  
  Log and store user queries for analysis.
  
- **Health Check Endpoint:**  
  Implement a `/health` endpoint to monitor system status.
