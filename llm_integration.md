# LLM Integration for Hotel Analytics

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of Language Learning Models (LLMs) into the Hotel Analytics system. The system uses LLMs to provide natural language question answering capabilities on hotel booking data.

## Technologies Used

### SentenceTransformers
SentenceTransformers is used to generate embeddings for hotel booking data. These embeddings enable semantic search functionality, allowing the system to find relevant information when answering questions.

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = model.encode(texts, show_progress_bar=True)
```

### FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
FAISS is used for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It stores the embeddings and enables fast retrieval of relevant data points.

```python
import faiss

dimension = embeddings.shape[1]
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(dimension)
index.add(embeddings)
```

### RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach:
1. **Retrieval**: When a question is asked, it's converted to an embedding and used to retrieve the most relevant data points from the FAISS index.
2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved data is formatted into context that provides the LLM with the most relevant information.
3. **Generation**: The LLM generates an answer based on the provided context and question.

### Vector Store
A custom VectorStore class manages the creation, storage, and querying of embeddings:

```python
class VectorStore:
    def __init__(self, texts, embeddings):
        self.texts = texts
        self.dimension = embeddings.shape[1]
        self.index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(self.dimension)
        self.index.add(embeddings)
    
    def search(self, query, k=5):
        query_embedding = model.encode([query])
        scores, indices = self.index.search(query_embedding, k)
        return [self.texts[i] for i in indices[0]]
```

## Question Answering Process

1. **Preprocess the Question**:
   - Clean and normalize the user's question.
   - Convert to an embedding using the same model used for the data.

2. **Retrieve Relevant Context**:
   - Search the vector store for data points most similar to the question.
   - Format the retrieved data into a context prompt.

3. **Generate Answer**:
   - Send the context and question to the LLM.
   - Process the LLM's response to ensure it's concise and accurate.
   - Include confidence scores and sources of information.

4. **Return Structured Response**:
   - Format the answer in a structured JSON format.
   - Include metadata such as confidence scores and sources.

## Performance Considerations

- **Batching**: Embeddings are generated in batches to optimize memory usage and processing time.
- **Caching**: Common questions and their embeddings are cached to improve response time.
- **Quantization**: The FAISS index is quantized to reduce memory usage while maintaining search accuracy.

## Example Integration

```python
def answer_question(self, question):
    # Retrieve relevant context
    context = self.vector_store.search(question)
    formatted_context = "\n".join(context)
    
    # Prompt construction
    prompt = f"""
    Context information:
    {formatted_context}
    
    Question: {question}
    
    Please answer the question based only on the provided context.
    """
    
    # Generate answer using LLM
    answer = self.llm.generate(prompt)
    
    # Add metadata
    return {
        "answer": answer,
        "confidence": self.calculate_confidence(answer),
        "sources": self.identify_sources(context)
    }
```

## Future Improvements

1. **Fine-tuning**: Fine-tune the embedding model on domain-specific hotel data to improve relevance.
2. **Multi-modal LLM**: Integrate charts and visualizations into responses.
3. **Conversational Memory**: Add memory of previous questions to support multi-turn conversations.
4. **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback system to improve answers over time.
5. **Multiple LLM Support**: Add support for different LLMs and select the best one based on the question type.
